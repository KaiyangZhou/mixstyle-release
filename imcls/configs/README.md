The `datasets/` folder contains dataset-specific config files which define the standard protocols (e.g., image size, data augmentation, network architecture) used by most papers. The `trainers/` folder contains method-specific config files which define optimization algorithms (e.g., optimizer, epoch) and hyperparameter settings.
